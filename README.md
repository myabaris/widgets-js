# Abaris Coding Challenge
For this project, you may use whatever javascript framework you are most comfortable with. If you have experience with React, that would be preferable since it is the framework we use most often. 

For this project you should not need any server side components. You do not need to communicate with an api and can store all 'widgets' in memory or local storage.

## Problem Description
You are building a widget shopping list. In this shopping list a user will be able to enter the name of an item, the quantity of items to be purchased and the unit price for an item. The shopping list should handle summing up the prices of each widget.

Roughtly, the shopping list should look like this:

| Name | Quantity | Price | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Widget A | 2 | $10.00 | Edit/Delete
| Widget B | 2 | $5.00 | Edit/Delete
|  |  | |
| Total | | $30.00 |

## Adding Widgets
A user must be able to add widgets to the list. When adding a widget, a user should be able to enter the widget's name, a quantity and the unit price.

## Editing Widgets
A user must be able to edit the shopping list and change the name of a widget, its quantity or its unit price.

## Deleting Widgets
A user must be able to remove any widget from the shopping list.

# Time to Spend & Evaluation
You should not spend more than 2 hours working on this assignment. The project is not intended to be fully completable in 2 hours so it is ok to not finish all of the features.

Your work will be evaluated by looking for things we value in the software we write. For example:

- Is the code well organized? Well organized code is easier to explain to others and tends to have fewer bugs.
- How readable is the code?
